## Week 10: Class Wrap-up and Showcase: Presenting your Strategic SciComm Plan

#### Course Evaluations

Please take 5 minutes to fill in the course evaluation: http://eval.franklin.uga.edu

This information is used for faculty's annual reviews - we pull quotes verbatium, and look at the overall scores. Constructive feedback is also used to improve the course in future years. 

#### Final Presntation Instructions

13 presentations x 5min each = 65minutes
And then 10 minutes for class wrap-up

#### Chapter 12: The need to take communication more seriously

Some take home points to wrap up the course:
1. **Strategic communication is difficult** - it takes time and money to do well, and would benefit from a team-based approach where scientists and science communicators work together over the long term.
2. **Collaborating on Science Communcation requries shared goals** - One great model for this is LTER-focused scicomm programs; a shared research site with lots of different research, staff, and opportunities for engaging both local and national communities
3. **A bigger role for scientific socieities** - to offer training, connect scientists and SciComm professionals, and coordinate efforts
4. **There is no easy answer to resources** - time and money are both at a premium, and requiements for both scale with the size of the project/audience/goals
5. **Everyone has their role** - from the invidivual grad student making labwork videos to large coordinated initiaves. Everyone has different strenths and motivations for putting in the work
