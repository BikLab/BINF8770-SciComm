## Week 7: Strategic Science Communication - Show warmth and integrity, and be willing to listen

_“Fostering trustworthiness-related beliefs is central to any long-term communications strategy. It is so important that a multibillion-dollar public relations (PR) industry has developed to serve all kinds of organizations’ needs to actively build positive relationships with a range of different stakeholders.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg. 72)

#### Show Warmth (Chapter 3)

“Trust” is a big and vague thing, and it would be more beneficial to think of this concept at a granular level, for example:

* Using technical language, or mentioning your PhD degree shows you are competent
* Sharing your motivations about an issue (e.g. climate change) shows you are caring

Both examples build trust with your audience in different ways.

Research on **warmth beliefs** spans a range of fields, including science communication, but also social psychology, organizational psychology, strategic communication, persuasion, health communication, and promotion.

Do you care about people like me?

* Humans make snap judgements about other people for putative evolutionary reasons: 1) does a person intend to do harm (do they show warmth?), and 2) do they have the ability to do harm (do they show competence?)

Warmth perceptions are not entirely dependent on first impressions (which you cannot entirely control) – _“We would thus expect that regular, ongoing exposure to direct and mediated communication that shows scientists behaving in a caring way will tend to lead to increasingly positive beliefs about scientists.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg. 76)”

BUT _“exhibiting coldness – perhaps an angry outburst or sneering comment – seems to damage perceptions in a way that may be hard to repair.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 76)

Scientists are lumped with accountants and lawyers – public audiences view us as “competent but cold”

To show warmth, scientists should:

1)	Treat others well and avoid being a jerk – in any face-to-face interaction, when talking to journalists, as well as when sharing things online. Behave well, pay attention to nonverbal cues, and tailor your language and style to the specific audience. 
2)	Actively share information about how their desire to help others motivates their research (or communication efforts). Storytelling can be very powerful for achieving this goal. 

_“Our fear is that many science communicator simply fail to prioritize communicating warmth because the objective and associated tactics simply are not choices they have spent much time thinking about .”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 88)

#### Show Integrity (Chapter 4)

Behaving ethically does not inherently lead to others’ integrity beliefs (e.g. media stories about unethical doctors/scientists, online commentators swaying opinions).

* We cannot control these factors or stories, but we are in charge of our own communication choices

National Science Board Survey data suggests that Americans have positive views about scientists’ motives – in that we “want to help solve problems”, “want to work for the good of humanity”, and “want to make life better for the average person”.

But, there are some ideological splits in viewpoints (Pew Research Center, November 2023, [“Americans’ Trust in Scientists, Positive Views of Science Continue to Decline”](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/11/14/americans-trust-in-scientists-positive-views-of-science-continue-to-decline/))

Survey data also reveals doubts about the integrity of the scientific community – especially in regard to industry (corporate) scientists, transparency about who pays for scientific research, and how scientific work benefits the public. 

Integrity can be broadly interpreted as “being honest” (talking about what you do to avoid conflicts of interest, taking steps to ensure your work can be checked/confirmed, etc.).

Conflict of Interest = where someone could benefit, financially, socially, or professionally from decisions for which they are at least partially responsible. 

* COIs are especially problematic when they are not adequately disclosed
* Keep in mind that the perception of bias dominates peoples’ thought processes – even COI disclosures (data transparency, independent advisory boards, keeping funders at arm’s length from research) cannot entirely counteract the damage to integrity when a corporate partner is involved in research
* Corporate involvement fundamentally makes people question the science, according to research studies.

_“Science communicators wanting to be perceived as honest may want to directly communicate why they think they should be seen as honest.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 107)

* As per study where an actor recorded fake interview for a Dean position

**Honesty is of paramount importance** - _“There do not seem to be any easy answers to actual integrity violations, beyond restarting the hard, long-term work of buiding back one’s reputation.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 108) 

* Be open and transparent about COIs and other negative information

There is public demand for integrity information – _“a solid majority of Americans say they want scientists to make their methods and data transparent, disclose funding, and state the peer-review status of their work.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 109)

* _“Scientists also need to find ways to both signal integrity and talk about how new data can change their minds.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 109)

#### Be Willing to Listen (Chapter 5)

Empathy beliefs and empathetic behavior are both about truly listening as opposed to simply showing warmth. 

**Cognitive** vs. **Affective** (or emotional) empathy:

* Someone may care deeply, but not actually be good at listening (and clueless as to what people need or want)
* Someone who is good at listening but not perceived as particularly warm or caring (e.g. a lawyer or banker who is motivated to make informed decisions)

**“Procedural Fairness as Voice”** – People are more accepting of decisions – even ones they disagree with – when they believe their was a meaningful opportunity to have their perspective heard during a decision-making process.

* Example from the justice system, but also applicable to science because of the deep history of racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression. 
* Why would people from traditionally marginalized groups trust scientific evidence (and scientists) if they have historically lacked a voice, and also been exploited/misled by past scientific studies?

Besley & Dudo “fully expect that people who do not feel listened to are likely to infer reasons for lack of attention.” (pg 122)

* NY State study about reintroducing moose populations – surveys showed that people who were satisfied with the process thought that the state was receptive to public opinion and provided a fair process for citizens to give input.
* BUT people with strong moral stances about an issue probably won’t be swayed by procedural structure or how much listening is done.

**Giving people a single opportunity to comment does NOT mean that you have given them a voice** – e.g. Nuclear Regulatory Commission example which included traditional town meetings, written comments, recorded video comments, and work with local community leaders such as pastors to promote participation.
