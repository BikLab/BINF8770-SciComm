## Week 8: Strategic Science Communication: Show you are not that different, show competence, and share risks and benefits

#### Chapter 6: Show you are not that different (and respect others’ differences)

_“Scientists share many of the values and interests of their neighbors…for adults, it might simply mean an opportunity to see scientists as fellow community members who are both eager to share their insights and learn from others.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 138)

* (but do your neighbors might know that?)

Your communication choices can change the odds that people will feel similar to you – will they see you as part of their own group (an in-group member) or part of another group (an out group member). 

**“In-reach”** (technical / scientific audiences) vs. **“Out-reach”** (non-scientist audiences)

Research by Douglas and Wildavasky - We can generally understand everyone’s values by finding out whether they prioritize: 
1) Individualism (valuing economic and personal freedom) or Communitarianism (ensuring rights of the entire community over an individual)
2) Hierarchy  (want people to respect and obey authority) or Egalitarianism (see less value in having to attend to oppressive oversight) 

Cultural values are how individuals and groups think the world – including social relationships – should be structured. _“Shared conceptions of what is good and desirable in the culture”_ (quote from Schwartz)
* People use their values to evaluate others and guide their own choices, and thus can drive views about a range of issues

_“In a time when there are too many complicated issues for any of us to understand, we all use our values to make sense of the world…you can often better predict someone’s views on nuclear energy by knowing their views about gun control, health issues, or global warming.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 142)

Cultural Cognition [Kahan et.al]:  people’s values affect—and often bias—what they feel and learn about public issues, including science topics

* The fact that most people partake in this kind of “motivated reasoning” makes it even important to illustrate how we share common experiences & values with our audiences

_“Evidence suggests that nonscientists with the most scientific knowledge seem to put their energy into learning what people within their cultural group think about scientific issues rather than what people in the scientific community think…taking a position against [their] own group could be both consequential and immediate in the form of ostracism.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 142)

* Climate Change (for people who value indivdiaualism/hierarchy) and Nuclear Waste (for people who value Communitarianism/Egalitarianism) are two examples where people develop beliefs that go against the prevailing scientific consensus
* _“…a host of forces causes all of us to seek out and pay more attention to information that affirms our values”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 143)

Kahn and collaborators study – surveys about HPV vaccine, climate change, etc. showed that survey respondants were more likely to trust experts and information that was consistent with their values (they used whatever cues they could – photos, biographies, books they read, etc.)

**Tactics** – communication choices about identity can really matter – vignette about climate change outreach in upstate New York, using local farmers, Georgia farmers, or French farmers as an an example (local farmers resonated most, especially for those who value individualism/hierarchichy) 

People with strong values will try to figure out what people in their cultural group are supposed to believe!

Perceptions of fair treatment are key for science communicators – treating people fairly can likely help contribute to a sense of shared social identification

#### Chapter 7: Show Competence

Trustworthiness beliefs often outweigh competence beliefs – e.g. we would tolerate (and forgive) a cook giving us an occasional subpar meal, but perhaps boycott the restaurant if he was known to spit in the food (doesn’t care) or embezzles money from the restaurant (lacks integrity). 

People in many countries tend to see scientists as very competent (2010 survey data)

**Competence** – _“defined as whether we think someone has the skills and intellectual capacity needed to play a role well”_ (Besley & Dudo pg. 164)

* Competence can also be referred to as ability, agency, credibility, or confidence (see Susan Fiske’s work)
* Can also be situation-specfic – e.g. cooking skill does not translate into chemistry knowledge

What we know about communicating competence:

* People shift their opinions towards the direction of “high credibility sources” in the short term (info coming from scientific journals, esteemed scientists)
* Fluent speech (cutting out pauses, hesitations, filler words, and repetitions) increases perceptions of the speaker’s competence – so definitely practice your public speaking skills, and get good at this!
* Reducing jargon and using plain language increases perceptions of competence – readers “subconsciously punish technical language” (study by Daniel Oppenheimer)
* Using statistics and numbers increases perceptions of competence, while narrative storytelling decreases competence perceptions (but note that storytelling helps foster warmth beliefs, which is also important!)
* Font choice, poor quality printing (i.e. low toner), and poor audio quality can lower the perception of a writer/speaker’s intelligence and competence
* Professional attire and presentation quality also increase competence perceptions

Focus on high-quality communications, but ensure high-quality of the underlying science  otherwise you risk coming across as a “smooth-talking snake-oil salesman” with style over substance

**What about controversy?**
* You can communicate that people arguing against a consensus are likely wrong
* You cannot be expected to confirm everyone else’s opinions
* We can only control how we ourselves communicate (we can’t control others)
* “As best we can tell, available evidence suggests that taking a controversial position may sometimes have a minor impact on the competence of science communicators, but these effects only occur for some issues and in some contexts.” (Besley & Dudo pg 170)

_“We get especially frustrated when we see science communicators who fail to prepare for communication opportunities with people outside the scientific community because we worry that it conveys incompetence, as well as disrespect. In isolation, these failures to prepare may not matter, but they could rpresent a problem if that is people’s primary experience with scientists.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 173)

#### Chapter 8: Share Risks and Benefits

Start of three chapters that summarizes on social science theory  & research about increasing the odds that people will choose certain behaviors (e.g. behavior change – Besley & Dudo Ch 8,9, 10)

The “Message Box” from COMPASS

**One Message Box = One Target Audience**

* **Issue**: (Your) Research Area,
* **Problems?**: Identifying a specific problem that your research tries to address (e.g. specific risk or challenge)
* **So what?**: Why should your chosen audience care? What specific benefit might someone gain by the solutions suggested by the research?
* **Benefits?**: Specific positive outcomes that may come from the types of solutions suggested by the research
* **Solutions?**:  Articulate In detail the solution that (your) research suggests. This box is meant to include the specific behavior the science communicator things will provide expected benefits that solve the stated problem.

We can assess people’s risk perceptions with two measures: (Besley & Dudo pg 186): 

1)	The degree to which people believe that the technology or activity is relatively well known (i.e. familiar, novel, etc.)
2)	People’s sense that the risk object is something that creates and involuntary threat over which they have little control (and is thus “dreaded”) 

Social scientists are trying to find beliefs correlated with a desired behavior AND where there is potential for communicators to foster change. 

* To be effective, communication messages must be relevant to the issue, AND focus on a message that is not already commonly known/believed by the target audience.
* Benefits and risks that first come to people’s minds (when asked about an issue) are not necessarily what influence their decision or behaviors.
* In practice, you may have to test out different arguments, seeing what resonates with your audience, and adjust as needed over continued interactions

_“It is quite common in risk perception research to find that people who see something as risky find ways to cognitively downplay the benefits and that people who see something as beneficial tend to downplay the risks.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 190)

Completely unrelated risks sometimes group together, e.g. Global warming + water pollution + animal extinction

Communicating uncertainty – the authors believe that the choice to communicate uncertainty should be based on ethics rather than strategy 
•	Don’t be unethical like Tobacco or Oil companies!
•	But also, don’t hide uncertainty because you are worried about negative reactions from your audience.
•	Figure out what is ethical, reasonable, and impactful for specific SciComm scenarios

Experiment: Trading in a normal cookie for a GM cookie – people were more willing to do so when they were first told about the benefits of genetically modified crops beforehand (less pesticide use, drought resistance, etc)

Health Belief Model – a person’s response to risk will be based on their perception of:

1)	The severity of a health threat
2)	The susceptibility of the health threat
3)	The benefits of a specific suggested action
4)	The barriers towards taking action

_“Even a science communicator who just wants a decision-maker to consider scientific evidence likely needs to convince the decision-maker that considering the evidence is worthwhile.“_ (Besley & Dudo pg 197)

How can your research project help solve a real problem? Useful to think about this early, and often in your graduate research (and beyond). 

_“It is not clear to us that the reason some people do not support science funding is because the scientific community has failed to adequately communicate that such funding provides benefits….8 in 10 American (83% in 2016) already agree…we are not sure how much room there is to move the needle on support for scientific funding by focusing on benefits.”_ (Besley & Dudo pg 199)
