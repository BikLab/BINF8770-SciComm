## Week 6: The Science Deficit Model and the pitfalls of pursuing science knowledge as a communications goal

The Science Deficit Model: removing a “deficit” in what people know will immediately change their beliefs, feelings, frames, and behaviors

Much science communication training (including many prominent programs/centers) convey a message that _“Effective communication is largely about being understandable and interesting”_ (Besley & Dudo). 

_Sharing scientific knowledge and getting people to feel things like excitement are only two of many potentially important communication objectives that communicators need to focus on if they have goals that involve affecting actual, real-world behavior_ (Besley & Dudo pg 50)

Being “clear and vivid” are only two tactics you can employ, out of many other potential tactics. 

SciComm training aimed at knowledge transfer via _“translation, distillation, or decoding”_ of complex concepts frames the problem of science communication largely in terms of comprehension. 

Scientists do not only just rate the objective of “sharing knowledge” most highly, but they rate it as the 

1) most ethical objective,
2) the one their colleagues would respect the most (and also be most likely to prioritize),
3) the objective that’s most feasible, and
4) the objective for which they themselves are most skillful.

A 2016 National Academies report concluded that _“available research does not support the claim that increasing science literacy will lead to appreciably greater support for science”_ (report PDF available here: https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23595/science-literacy-concepts-contexts-and-consequences) 

_"We would go so far as to say that getting science communicators to think beyond knowledge objectives is the core challenge facing science communication researchers today."_ (Besley & Dudo pg 54)

Besley & Dudo think some of these critiques go to far, and see the focus on the “deficit model” as an overreliance on a single objective. They also think it would be odd if knowledge was not an important objective for science communicators. 

**It is important to remember:** _"Researchers’ unique access to hard-won knowledge is the ticket that gets us invited to play a central role in public (and private) discussions about issues in which we have expertise._ (Besley & Dudo pg 54)

Reports from informal science educators (at museums, zoos, aquariums, etc.) suggest that you should:

1)	Start with a clear identification of what you want a group of people to learn
2)	Then figure out what those people already know about that topic
3)	The next challenge is to build interesting and interactive activities that motivate people in the target group to learn the content that you want them to learn, with each lesson/activity building on previous ones.
   
The effectively creates a series of scenarios in which people teach themselves rather than trying to give people information and hope they retain that information. **(Although note that much of informal education focuses on younger audiences)**

Portal to the Public – training starts with educational theories and “how people learn” 
•	This is also consistent with ideas found in persuasion research – how do people come to believe what they believe?

#### Jargon

* People are unlikely to learn if they cannot understand the discussion
* We all have a “curse of knowledge” in that it will be hard to figure out what terms people find confusing or incomprehensible – and jargon terms will almost certainly vary by audience
* To engage people with science, you must ensure that they are 1) motivated to process and 2) able to process your message

#### Dialogue 

Citizen Conference on Food Biotechnology case study: 

* Creating dialogue-focused situations may help people slow down and think through science and technology issues
* Dialogue can contribute to learning as a function of cognitive processing
* Learning about the science was not the only type of “learning” that occurred - Participants also developed other types of beliefs about the technology, key actors, and their own selves
* Research has shown that exposure and attention to a range of ideas through media and interpersonal discussion is associated with relatively higher levels of knowledge – news/media can be thought of as “mediated dialogue” and have cumulative effects over time.
* Reading and talking seem to be especially important, as they require higher levels of cognitive effort

## Two closing concerns to ponder

1)	Motivating people to think deeply about an issue may lead them to learn incorrect science (including misinformation or disinformation) 
2)	Focusing too much on knowledge may “lead scientists to act like jerks”
