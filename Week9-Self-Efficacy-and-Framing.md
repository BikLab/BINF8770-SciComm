## Week 9: Strategic Science Communication - Share what other people think is normal, foster self-efficacy, and share emotions and frames (carefully!)

#### Chapter 9: Share what other people think is normal

**Descriptive Norms** – perceptions about other people’s behaviors
* Do other people reuse the same towel when staying at a hotel?
* Helps people to decide what to do in situations with ambiguity – what are others doing?

**Injunctive/Subjective Norms** – beliefs about what other people expect
* Do other people think you should reuse the same towel at a hotel?
* Complying with these norms help people fit into a group

Besley & Dudo argue that _“science communicators should consider prioritizing communicatying about the sometimes-hidden behaviors and expectations of people who are important to their key audiences.”_ 

[MSU Ducks Campaign](https://www.instagram.com/msusocialnorms/?hl=en) - cartoon ducks posters aimed at promoting responsible drinking behavior (logic of the campaign is that “students make better decisions when  they believe most other students are also making good decisions”)

Communicating social norms is important because people often (pg 208):
1)	Use other people’s behaviors and opinions to make sense of an uncertain world, especially when they want to fit in
2)	Make mistakes when they try to assess what others think and do because they rely on their own limited experiences 

“People are especially bad at assessing other people when the relevant behaviors and opinions are hard to observe. Worse, given how rarely humans have the motivation or ability to think deeply about most things, most of us will tend to use easily available information to assess social norms.” (Besley & Dudo pg 208)

Littering experiment – (note: Japan is another good example, few public trash cans but no litter anywhere!) 

Besley & Dudo’s core argument is that science communicators could likely benefit by doing more to communicate what key people 
1)	Do about an issue (e.g. are friends and family cutting energy use?)
2)	Expect others to do about an issue (e.g. is cutting energy use morally good?)

“We often see behaviors as more acceptable when we see more people doing them, and we often believe more people do behaviors we perceive as socially desirable.” (Besley & Dudo pg 211)

Collective norms – people’s actual behaviors and expectations

What we think is normal is a belief accumulated over time – through media consumption, communication, and life experiences

Implicit (people infer social norms) vs. explicit (people are told what is normal) messaging -– people may try to mentally counterargue with explicit messages, however implicit messaging is very difficult for SciComm (since you can’t control situations like in social science experiments) 

People with strong beliefs or strong moral stances are unlikely to be swayed by normative information. 

Most research on social norms has focused on individual behavior (hand washing, energy useage, drinking less), but some research has found that social norm messaging can influence civic behavior (voting, making donations, etc.) which is a good sign for SciComm goals which are often focused on civic engagement. 

Hypothesis that consensus perceptions (e.g. climate change) are “gateway beliefs” that can lead people to develop other beliefs consistent with the consensus. BUT, 
•	Consensus messaging may not work on highly partisan respondents (may polarize the debate and be wasted effort)
•	Research only focuses on very short term studies, and it may not lead to substantive, long-term changes

#### Chapter 10: Foster Self-Efficacy

Self-efficacy beliefs - when people perform behaviors they believe they have the ability and opportunity to perform (e.g. eating less, driving less, underrepresented groups pursuing STEM careers)

“The idea of self-efficacy has emerged as a crucial driver of whether someone will try a challenging behavior, the amount of effort that will go into achieving that behavior, and whether the effort will be sustained over time.” (Besley & Dudo pg 228)

Perceived behavioral control – people sometimes fail to do a behavior because they are simple unable to or feel unable to (e.g. baking homemade bread, building a garden shed)
•	Lack of skills and resources can create barriers for people considering a behavior
•	Lack of skills may come from perceptions of capacity or internal control (“internal efficacy” – a person’s sense of one’s own competence) 
•	Lack of resources could be lack of autonomy or external control, stemming from economic, regulatory, or time-based pressures. 

Self-efficacy makes scientists more willing to be science communicators!
•	Those who believe they have engagement skills and time to engage are more willing to do SciComm
•	Skill beliefs are also correlated with a willingness to prioritize novel engagement objectives and tactics

When your target audience is failing to carry out a goal behavior, ask whether…
•	They don’t think they have the skill or resources (including decision-making authoirity)
•	A true barrier actually exists (e.g. their income is too low to buy an electric car) – in which case communication alone cannot solve the problem

People can develop self-efficacy through:
•	Direct experiences (the most impactful approach in educational + civic contexts)
•	Vicarious experiences (watching others perform a behavior in person or online)
•	Reading or hearing things, including advertisements, self-help books, or fiction

Effects of self-efficacy may occur in relation to emotional responses, including hope, fear, and anger – there is a lack of evidence that scare tactics are effective (especially if the threat doesn’t have a feasible solution, or people don’t have the ability to enact a solution).

“The clear implication is that communicators who want people to do a behavior need to spend at least some of their time ensuring that target audiences believe they have the skills and capacity to conduct the desired behavior. We cannot assume that people will do a beheavior just because they believe the behavior is objectively beneficial.” (Besley & Dudo pg 234)

“In one widely cited study, the simple presence of female role models seemed to communicate science-related self-efficacy to female students and associated career intentions” (Besley & Dudo pg 234)

But self-efficiacy can be misplaced…
•	For example, when people think that expertise in one area (e.g. science) translates directly into expertise in another area (e.g. science communication)
•	High-self efficacy can also cause people to put less effort into tasks or behavior (e.g. studying less for an exam that you’re confident you will pass) – can lead to a lack of willingness to change.
•	If someone has high-self efficacy but doesn’t believe the behavior is useful (e.g. recycling, emailing your congressional representative)

#### Chapter 10: Share emotions and frames, carefully

Emotions – affective responses that people use to make sense of the world (fear, anger, joy, hope, disgust, etc.)
Framing – how a person thinks about an issue in the world

There are no “correct” or “incorrect” emotions or frames! 

Emotions and frames can be thought of hidden heuristic processes (e.g. shortcuts useful for the brain) – different emotions/framing can help people think more (or less) carefully about a given issue. 

General Affect – a feeling that something is positive or negative to some degree
•	Different from specific emotions one might experience (e.g. anger, excitement)

“…Providing people benefit information tended to decrease risk beliefs, and providing people risk information tentded to decrease benefit beliefs. Both results—the tendency to conflate risks and benefits when rushed and the tendency to use irrelevant information to judge risks and benefits—can best be explained if people partly rely on general affect rather than specific, deeply considered beliefs when making risk and benefit judgements.” (Besley & Dudo pg 247-248)
•	Because of this unconscious general affect reaction, it can take time and sustained effort for science communicators to impact affective responses/heuristics.
•	But knowledge about general affect doesn’t help us decide *what* to communicate (it only helps us understand how people respond to risk)

Fear-followed-by-hope is an effective method for spuring people to take action!

“Her [Robin Nabi’s] research suggests that starting with a fear message about climate change, for example, and following it up with a message about the health benefits of potential climate change solutions resulted in more hope than when a fear message was accompanied by an efficacy message that emphasized the health losses that might occur if we do not take action.” (Besley & Dudo pg 249)

Similaly, humor can be a powerful tool! 
•	“…a funny clip somewhat decreased fear (and risk perceptions) but still have a net positive impact on self-reported intent to take action to respond to climate change as a result of people perceiving the video as funny.” (Besley & Dudo pg 249)

However, beware that “the news media may often load emotional content onto science stories, in ways that can distract people from evidence-based decision-making.” (Besley & Dudo pg 250)

Science communication should thus aim for pleasant (or at least, not unpleasant) experiences – for the benefit of the communicators themselves, and the target audience’s enjoyment (or at least positive affect)

Framing choices can be complex (and difficult to parse) around any given issue – e.g. news media study showing at least 7 main ways to frame the issue of nuclear power. 

Some approaches to framing:
•	Emphasis Framing – pushes an audience to think about an issue in a specific way (e.g. framing climate change as a health issue)
o	The content of the message – including tactical choices, terminology, tones, visuals, metaphors, analogies, characters and narratives – can very to suggest a particular way of thinking about the underlying issue and an associated solution.
•	Equivalence Framing – changing the emphasis without changing the core component (e.g. Tversky/Kahneman study where changing the presentation of the data about disease death vs. recovery impacted survey respondents’ answers in predictable ways).
o	Everyday examples – a glass being half-empty vs. half-full, milk being 99% fat-free or having 1% fat.
•	Generic frames – general frames that make sense for multiple issues. These can include:
o	Conflict Framing – the issue comes across as a conflict between two sides (e.g. Homeowners want X, but the Government wants Y). Conflict framing is often just lazy journalism, where too much attention is given to contrarian voices!
o	Episodic Framing – where an issue is presented as something that affects a single individual or specific event. (e.g. a homeowner losing their home during a specific hurricane) – tugs on emotional heartstrings but mistakenly implies we need to solve problems one at a time (vs. see the broader issue)
o	Thematic framing – focus is put on the overall issue, rather than a specific antidote 

“For framing to work, people need ot have a concept available in their head (e.g. the value of saving lives) that is cognitively accessible when faced with a new situation. Put differently, framing can make specific types of beliefs relevant to the underlying issue.” (Besley & Dudo pg. 255)

Terminology can be a compelling (and divisive) way to frame issues:
•	“climate change” vs. “global warming”
•	“genetic engineering” vs. “genetic modification”
•	“estate taxes” vs. “death taxes” 


“Construal Level” framing – making choices about how concretely or abstractly an issue is described
